<center><h3>What new technology do we need at our school?</h3></center>
<div></div>
<p>Our school is in dire need of a defense system to protect our school from ISIS terrorists. Therefore, whenever we get a new school we need a top of the line defense system. We, first, need a tsar bomb nuclear missile silo. Then we need a wall (but a fence will do in some places) with armed guards all around it. Finally, every student should be equipped with a firearm instead of a laptop so that they can defend themselves.</p>
