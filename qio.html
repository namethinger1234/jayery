  <h1>What I'm doing for spring Break.</h1>

   <p>This year I don't get to do very much because I have to go to driver's ed. *𝘤𝘳𝘪 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘮* Therefore I'll probably be at home for most of my spring break. I'm going to have to go to drivers ed from 8am to 3pm so its really no better than going to regular school. I don't even get to do the driving part either.</p>

   <p>Other than that, I might hang out with some of my friends after drivers ed. Hopefully I can go to Quinessential Sweets because they have pretty good sno-cones. I guess in the rest of my free time I'll play video games and watch TV. Normal things. I'm just thankful that I don't have to deal with any homework for the week (and I think one of my friends is doing the same driver's ed as me.) So, yeah my spring break is going to be 11/10. </p>
